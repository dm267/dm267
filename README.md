I'm a MEng Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence Graduate from [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/) with aspirations to work in a role which combines data science and machine learning engineering to solve real world problems.

### 4th Year
During my 4th year at Southampton I wanted to further my knowledge of AI and Data Science and thus completed modules such as Data Visualisation, Computational Finance, Data Mining, Social Media and Network Science as well as curbing my insatiable thirst for business through E-Business Strategy. 

My Masters dissertation was completed as a Group Design Project titled: "Intelligence Framework for 5G Networks", and focussed on applying Machine Learning algorithms to deployed conditional handover and trafic steering systems which were demonstrated to be extremely successful through bespoke in-house developed test simulation environments. This project strived for lower latency and higher throughput to support the increased needs of 5G and beyond networks and ultimately ended up with state of the art models, achieving a 1st class mark.

### 3rd Year
During my 3rd year at Southampton I studied modules such as Machine Learning Technologies, Computer Vision, Social Computing Technologies and Natural Language Processing. 

My undergraduate dissertation was titled: "Beyond Digital Profiling: Social Media Profile Analysis via Machine Learning for Personality Recognition and Prediction", 
and focused on a multi-faceted approach to predict a Twitter users personality type by building various Machine Learning algorithms and ended up achieving a 1st class mark.
